# Memory Card Game
This is a memory card game thet was ceated with javascript language for educational purposes. The goal of this project is to create a simple memory game where the player can entertain him/herself and at the same time practice/improve memory skills.

# UX

Ideal User:
The ideal users for this game would be adults and children above 10 years old.

1. As an user at this game, I would like to be able to entertain myself playing a memory card game.
2. As an user of this game, I want to be able to practice my memory skills.
3. As an user of this game, I would like to play the game at anytime in any device.
4. As a plaer of this game, I would like to be stimulated to match the cards as fast as possible. 

### Strategy
The goal of this project was to create a memory card game, where the user can entertain him/herself and practice memory skills at anytime in anyplace.

### Scope
This game game can be played at different devices suchs as desktops, laptops, tablets and cel phones, due it's responsiveness. As matching the cards as fast as possible is the goal at the game, a progressive timer has been added with the purpose to stimulate the player to improve memory skills by allowing him/her to track the time that has been taken to match all the cards.

### Structure
When the player starts the game by clicking the start button, a pop-up message shows up with basic instructions. Once the pop-up box is closed the timer turns to yellow color and starts running progressivilly.
As soon that all the cards are matched, the timer stops and turns to green color, indicating that the game is finished.

### Skeleton
The mockup of this project can be find above at the "skeleton" folder.

### Surface
The layout of this project can be find above at the "surface" folder.

# Features
The game has a card borad 16 cards with 8 different images. Also, besides a timer that runs progressively there's a start button, that when is clicked shows a message with instructions.
As soon as the pop-up box with instructions is closed, the timer starts runing and it's color change to yellow.
When the player match all the cards, timer stops and turn it color to green.

### Features to be implemented
For the future I would like to change the timer to a regressive mode(for ex. 02:00 minutes to find all cards) and then I would like to create new levels increasing difficulty with less time (for ex. 01:00 minute to match all cards). I think that would estimulate the player to think faster and improve memory skills.
Also, it could be interesting to have a table with player's best times, so they can keep track of their progress.
For last, I also would like to implement the style of the pop-up messages.
